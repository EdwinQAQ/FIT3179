                <p><b>Earthquakes, a significant natural calamity capable of causing global devastation, form the core focus of this research.</b>
                    <br><br>Earthquakes are a natural phenomenon resulting from the Earth's internal structure and the movement of tectonic plates. The Earth's crustal plates continually shift, collide, and separate, leading to the accumulation of stress within the crust. When this stress reaches a critical point, it is abruptly released, causing seismic vibrations and the formation of earthquakes. Volcanic activity and human actions can also induce earthquakes. Earthquakes typically cluster at tectonic plate boundaries, which are high-risk areas for seismic activity.
                    <br><br><b>In this visualization, the distribution of earthquakes will be presented.</b>
                    <br><br>The goal is to analyze historical seismic events, particularly in regions marked by elevated seismic activity. Through this visualization, a better understanding of earthquake distribution and causative factors is achieved, thus improving predictive and responsive capabilities for this natural disaster.

            <p><span class= 'highlight'><b>Magnitude (Richter scale)</b></span>
            <br><br> Earthquake magnitudes represent the energy released during an earthquake, quantifying its size and impact. A higher magnitude indicates a stronger earthquake with greater potential for damage.

            <p><span class= 'highlight'><b>Earthquakes are the most common triggers of tsunamis. </b></span>
            <br><br>When rocks within the Earth's crust shift along fault lines, the released energy disrupts the seabed water, generating tsunami waves.

        <div id='Explain-depth'>
            <p><span class= 'highlight'><b>Earthquake depth doesn't directly determine magnitude. </b></span>
            <br><br>Magnitude is influenced by various factors, including energy release, fault type, and geological conditions. Depth impacts perception and range but isn't the sole determinant of magnitude.
